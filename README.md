# Wysper

I’m a former OpenAI software engineer.

I built Wysper after a tragic accident left my parents unable to work.  
It’s an autonomous trading agent designed to generate income with defined risk and disciplined execution.

One wallet. No noise. Just compounding.

This repository documents the build publicly.  
Bear with me — the project is just getting started.
